          You wake up in what seems like a storage room. You hear a faint
          buzzing from some sort of machine and you feel that you're definitely
          moving.<br />You look around and the only thing you see is a door and
          a locker.
        </p>
        <p>Do you >inspect the locker or >exit the room?</p>

          You walk up to the the locker and to your surprise it's open. You
          can't really comprehend what you're looking at but it looks like an
          assortment of weird hats and various trash. There's one that catches your eye,
          it's a party hat. Much like the one you had on your 5th birthday.
        </p>
        <p>Do you put on the hat before you leave the room?</p><br>
        <span>>yes or >no?</span>

      <div id="use-hat" class="text-box hidden">
        <p>
          You put the party hat on your head and for a brief moment it takes you
          back to your childhood. You wonder what happened with all that joy and
          wanderlust you had. After a minute you snap back into real life again
          and you understand that you have to leave this room.
        </p>

          When you exit the door you find yourself in a long corridor. You're
          now certain that you're on a spaceship. After 2 years in the field as
          an space electrician you should know. Your vision is not the greatest,
          it seems like the lights are out and the ship is running on backup
          power. On the wall you see a sign that shows your whereabouts. Left
          for cafeteria and right for electrical.

          You take a left in the corridor and head for the cafeteria. Your
          stomach is aching, God knows how long you've been out. When you're
          just a few steps away from the cafeteria the doors slams violently.
          They can not be opened by force, and also let's face it, your second
          name never was muscle. You figure something must be done and you see
          it as your task to fix the wiring so you can get some food.
        </p>
        <p>Go >back.</p>

          You head for the electric room down the hall. The hallway is empty and
          you could hear a needle drop. Suddenly when you pass the medical ward
          you hear a rustle above you in the ventilation system, it freaks you
          out for a bit but you figure it's just a rat. Damn space rats. <br />
          <br />
          When you finally find the room you've been looking for you see that
          someone have been tampering with the wires to the system. They have
          been cut off. You try to reconnect the cables and as soon as you're
          about to connect the blue cable you notice that the ventilation shaft
          next to you bursts open and this... creature... emerges. It looks like
          your old crewmate but something's off, you realize one second too late
          that it must be an imposter. The last thing you feel is the tounge of
          the monster impaling you.
        </p>
        <p>You are dead. Type >restart to try again.</p>
